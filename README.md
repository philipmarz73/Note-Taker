# Note Taker

This Project called for the creation of a simple, but fully-functional Note Taker application. It should easily allow the User to create and save notes, so that they can be viewed at a later time, and deleted when no longer required. It required practice in creating files that allowed for data persistence via a 'db.json' file using the 'fs' module.

## Requirements

The application front end was supplied for this exercise; we were to create the back end and link the two for full functionality.
